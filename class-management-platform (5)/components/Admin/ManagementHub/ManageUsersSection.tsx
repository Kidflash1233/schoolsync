// - ManagementHub.tsx (main orchestration)
// - UnifiedEntityList.tsx (displaying users)
// - CreateEntityWizardModal.tsx (creating/editing user properties)
// - ManageLinksModal.tsx (linking users to classes/students)
// This file can be safely removed in a future cleanup if no longer referenced.
